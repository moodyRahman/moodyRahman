### Hello, and welcome to my Github!
##### I'm Moody Rahman, a "whatever the hell you need" software engineer. Stuvesant High School Alumni, current student of Hunter Daedalus, and hackNY fellow '22.

I'm a software engineer with a passion for making tools that make my life (and coincidentally other lives) easier. I've worked with countless different technologies, and I'm always working on something new! My current preferred stack is Mongodb, Flask, and the Bootstrap component library + React.  
I also love working on web infrastructure, amidst server configs and the terminal I'm happiest :)
