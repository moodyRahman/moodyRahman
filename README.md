### Hello, and welcome to my Github!
##### I'm Moody Rahman, programming for past 7 years and counting, Stuvesant High School Alumni, and current student of Hunter Daedalus.

I'm a software engineer with a passion for making tools that make my life (and coincidentally other lives) easier. I've worked with countless different technologies, and I'm always working on something new! My current preferred stack is Mongodb, Flask, and the Bootstrap component library + React. 
Currently learning Rust!
