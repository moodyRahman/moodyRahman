### Hello, and welcome to my Github!
##### I'm Moody Rahman, a Devops/Site Reliability/Platform/Cloud engineer. Stuvesant High School Alumni, current student of Hunter Daedalus, and hackNY fellow '22.

I'm a software engineer with a passion for making tools that make my life (and coincidentally other lives) easier. I've worked with countless different technologies, and I'm always working on something new! My current preferred stack is Mongodb, Express.js, and React.  
I also love working on web infrastructure, and it's amidst server configs and the terminal I'm happiest :)
