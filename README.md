### Hello, and welcome to my Github!
##### I'm Moody Rahman, an engineer who refuses to leave their terminal. Stuvesant High School '20, Dadalus@Hunter College '24, and hackNY fellow '22. 

I have a passion for making tools that make my life (and coincidentally other lives) easier. 
I've worked with countless different technologies, and I'm always working on something new! Currently obsessed with SvelteKit.  
I also love working on web infrastructure, and DevOps tools, it's amidst server configs and the terminal I'm happiest :)
